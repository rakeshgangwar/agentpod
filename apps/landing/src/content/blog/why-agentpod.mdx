The motivation behind AgentPod came from a clear need: **portability with coding agents** and a platform for **experimenting with new UI paradigms**.

## The TUI Revolution

With the emergence of TUI-based coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more recently OpenCode (which powers this very project), we're witnessing a revolution in how developers interact with AI. These terminal-based tools are incredibly powerful.

But here's the problem: **TUIs are difficult to work with on screens other than desktop.**

Try using Claude Code on a tablet. Or running Gemini CLI from your phone. It's nearly impossible. These powerful tools are trapped in desktop environments.

## The Security Problem

There was another pressing issue: **sandboxing**.

AI agents that can run arbitrary commands on your primary laptop? That's a security nightmare waiting to happen. We needed isolation. We needed containers. We needed a way to let agents do their work without risking our main system.

## OpenCode Server: The Godsend

This is where [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) became a godsend.

OpenCode's server mode allows running the agent in sandboxed containers while the client runs on your primary machine to interact with users. This separation of concerns is exactly what we needed:

- **Server**: Runs in Docker containers, isolated and sandboxed
- **Client**: Runs on any device — desktop, tablet, or phone
- **Connection**: Secure communication between client and server

## What AgentPod Does

AgentPod takes this architecture and makes it accessible:

1. **Spin up sandboxes** — Docker containers or Cloudflare workers
2. **Connect from anywhere** — Desktop app now, mobile coming soon
3. **Stay safe** — Your laptop stays clean, agents stay isolated
4. **Use any LLM** — 75+ providers supported through OpenCode

## The Vision

We're building the "Portable Command Center" — your personal AI-powered development environment that travels with you.

Desktop support is complete. Mobile is in progress. The future is portable.
