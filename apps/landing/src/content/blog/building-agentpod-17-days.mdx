On December 5th, 2025, the first commit landed: "Initial commit: Portable Command Center project setup." 17 days and 337 commits later, AgentPod is a fully functional desktop application with production-ready infrastructure.

Here's how it happened.

## The Timeline

### Day 1 (Dec 5): Foundation

- Initial project scaffold with Tauri v2 + SvelteKit
- Phased implementation guides for 6 development phases
- OpenCode Docker image for container deployment
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Infrastructure Setup

Started with a clear vision: Tauri for cross-platform native app, SvelteKit for the frontend, connecting to a Hetzner VPS running Coolify for container orchestration.

### Day 2 (Dec 6): API & Desktop App

- Management API with Bun + Hono framework
- SQLite database with full CRUD operations
- **Phase 2 Complete**: API with 39 tests passing
- Tauri desktop app with project management
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Desktop foundation
- OpenCode integration with SSE streaming
- Chat UI with assistant-ui (React)
- File browser with Shiki syntax highlighting
- **Phase 4 at 95%**: Core features working

This was the most intense day. Went from nothing to a working chat interface with real-time streaming in a single push.

### Day 3 (Dec 7): Configuration & Permissions

- Human-in-the-loop permission system
- OpenCode configuration architecture
- Container tier system (starter, builder, creator, power)
- code-server (VS Code in browser) integration
- AGENTS.md editor for AI agent rules

### Days 4-5 (Dec 8-9): Architecture Deep Dive

- Comprehensive UI/UX analysis and implementation plan
- Generative UI architecture documentation
- ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) Gateway implementation
- Modular container architecture

### Day 6 (Dec 10): Daytona POC

- Self-hosted Daytona sandbox proof-of-concept
- Comprehensive README documentation

### Day 7 (Dec 11): Monorepo Migration

- Restructured entire project to Turborepo monorepo
- Migrated to OpenCode SDK
- Added Keycloak OAuth authentication (later replaced)
- Modular container system with resource tiers

### Day 8 (Dec 12): The Great Simplification

- **Removed Coolify** — Replaced with direct Docker API
- **Removed Forgejo** — Filesystem-based Git
- **Removed Keycloak** — Replaced with Better Auth
- V2 API with direct Docker orchestration
- Theme system with 20 presets

This was a pivotal day. The original architecture was complex (Coolify + Forgejo + Keycloak). We simplified to direct Docker API + Better Auth.

### Days 9-10 (Dec 13-14): Testing & Onboarding

- **411 tests** added (unit + integration + e2e)
- PostgreSQL migration with Drizzle ORM
- Comprehensive onboarding system
- Agent management system

### Days 11-12 (Dec 15-16): UI Polish

- Terminal/cyberpunk UI redesign
- Modular theme system (color schemes + font pairings)
- Interactive terminal with xterm.js
- Session activity tracking
- Command Center homepage
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+, for agents, Alt+, for models)

### Day 13 (Dec 17): Production Readiness

- Responsive mobile UI with bottom navigation
- **Production infrastructure**: Loki + Fluent Bit + Grafana
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt + Traefik
- iOS project files for Tauri iOS builds
- **Phase 6 Complete**: Production ready

### Days 14-15 (Dec 18-19): Features & Release

- Rebranded CodeOpen → AgentPod
- Voice input with Whisper + OpenWakeWord
- Admin panel with signup control
- Git branch management and diff viewing
- Tauri release workflow for all platforms
- Web preview feature with Traefik dynamic routing
- Model doctor command for agent configuration

### Days 16-17 (Dec 20-21): Cloudflare & Landing

- **Cloudflare Sandbox SDK integration**
- Hybrid architecture: Docker + Cloudflare workers
- Hibernation wake UI for sleeping sandboxes
- Automatic workspace sync to R2 storage
- MCP plugin for AI agent debugging
- **Landing page** with terminal/cyberpunk design

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Commits | 337 |
| Development Days | 17 |
| Commits/Day Average | ~20 |
| Tests | 411 |
| Container Flavors | 6 |
| Themes | 20+ |
| LLM Providers | 75+ |

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Tauri over Electron** — Native performance, smaller bundle
2. **SvelteKit over React** — Simpler reactivity with Svelte 5 runes
3. **Better Auth over Keycloak** — Embedded, simpler, less infrastructure
4. **Direct Docker API over Coolify** — Full control, fewer moving parts
5. **Hybrid Sandboxes** — Docker for dev, Cloudflare for quick tasks

## What's Next

- Mobile apps (iOS/Android) — Tauri v2 enables this
- ACP Gateway — Standardized multi-agent interactions
- Web client — Browser-based access

The foundation is solid. Now we build on top of it.
