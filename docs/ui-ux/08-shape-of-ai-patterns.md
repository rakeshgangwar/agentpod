## Category 1: Wayfinders

> Help users construct their first prompt and get started.

### 1.1 Initial CTA
**Large, open-ended input inviting the user to start their first interaction.**

**Key Insights:**
- The blank canvas problem: "What is the likelihood that five words are enough to describe your creative vision?"
- Direct input has become default, but most people don't know how to phrase what they want
- Solution: Keep input box at center but surround with **supportive scaffolding**

**Scaffolding Types:**
- **Suggestions**: Common prompts surfaced near input
- **Galleries**: Example outputs showing range and possibility
- **Prompt enhancers**: Reformat user input for better AI results
- **Modes/selectors**: Switch between query types
- **Attachments**: Drop files for richer context
- **Templates**: Pre-built entry points

**CTA Variants:**
- **Action-first CTA**: AI as feature alongside traditional options (Typeform)
- **Contextual CTA**: AI introduced after data exists (Otter - after transcript)
- **Playful CTA**: Lower bar with humor/randomness (Udio)

**Design Considerations:**
- Make first step forgiving - scaffold short prompts with examples
- Spend compute wisely - structure input to reduce guessing
- Show range before depth
- Balance novelty and clarity

---

### 1.2 Suggestions
**Solves the blank canvas dilemma with clues for how to prompt.**

**Forms of Suggestions:**
- **Static**: Fixed starters for onboarding (product features)
- **Contextual**: Shift based on page/document content
- **Adaptive**: Evolve from user behavior over time

**Design Considerations:**
- Make suggestions actionable (clicking runs the prompt)
- Leverage contextual clues (attachments, mode changes)
- Scope when suggestions appear (don't show everywhere)
- Keep set small and ranked (3-6 options)
- Design for first-run learning
- Respect safety and cost

---

### 1.3 Follow Up
**Get more information when initial prompt isn't sufficiently clear.**

**Use Cases:**
- **Open conversation**: Probe deeper into user interests
- **Compute-heavy tasks**: Ensure understanding before expensive generation
- **Action-oriented flows**: Nudges and inline actions

**Variations:**
- Conversation extenders
- Clarifying questions
- Depth probes
- Comparisons
- Action nudges
- Share/Export options

**Design Considerations:**
- Anchor follow ups in what just happened
- Show why you're suggesting something
- Keep list short and scannable
- Balance depth and breadth
- Preserve conversational rhythm
- Let users select/regenerate options

---

### 1.4 Templates
**Structured templates that can be filled by user or pre-filled by AI.**

**Purpose:**
- Make complex prompts easy to construct
- Users don't have to describe everything (set parameters, fill key info)
- Blend of parameters, suggested prompts, and text inputs

**Design Considerations:**
- Minimize manual work (use variables, @-mentioning)
- Chain templates together for workflows
- Keep references to source

---

### 1.5 Example Gallery
**Share sample generations, prompts, and parameters to educate and inspire.**

**Gallery Types:**
- **Curated**: Hand-selected by platform team
- **Community**: User submissions with voting/trending
- **Dynamic**: Algorithmically surfaced based on context

**Common Traits:**
- Clear previews (thumbnails, clips)
- Structured organization (categories, tags, filters)
- Actionable examples ("start from here", remix)
- Varied samples (polished + everyday)
- Attribution and context

**Design Considerations:**
- Make browsing easy with search/filters
- Use metadata as teaching material
- Reflect product's strengths
- Balance curation and community
- Maintain freshness
- Use gallery as onboarding

---

### 1.6 Other Wayfinders

- **Prompt Details**: Show what's happening behind the scenes
- **Randomize**: Kickstart with low bar and fun results

---

## Category 2: Prompt Actions (Inputs)

> Different actions that users can direct AI to complete.

### 2.1 Open Input
Open-ended prompt inputs for natural language prompting.

### 2.2 Inline Action
**Ask or interact with AI contextually based on something on the page.**

**Common Actions:**
- Suggested prompts opening new discussion
- Restructuring actions (rewrite, reframe)
- Restyling actions (tone, aesthetic)
- Transformational actions (change modality)

**Multi-modality:** Not limited to text - can apply to images, audio, live conversations.

**Design Considerations:**
- Offer concise, high-value defaults (shorten, expand, summarize)
- Rely on context to make actions relevant
- Enable granular selection and scoping
- Preview before commit
- Surface reasoning when stakes are high

---

### 2.3 Regenerate
Have AI reproduce response without additional input.

### 2.4 Transform
Change the modality of content.

### 2.5 Other Actions
- **Auto-fill**: Extend prompt to multiple fields
- **Chained Action**: Sequential AI operations
- **Describe**: Decompose into fundamental tokens
- **Expand**: Add depth and details
- **Inpainting**: Target specific areas to regenerate
- **Madlibs**: Repeated tasks with format consistency
- **Restructure**: Use existing content as starting point
- **Restyle**: Transfer styles without changing structure
- **Summary**: Distill to essence
- **Synthesis**: Reorganize complex info into simple structure

---

## Category 3: Tuners

> Adjust contextual data, token weights, and input details to refine the prompt.

### 3.1 Attachments
**Give AI specific reference to anchor its response.**

**Attachment Methods:**
- **Direct upload**: File, connection, @-mention
- **Inline action**: Text selection, overlay menus
- **URL embed**: Paste link, AI fetches page
- **Canvas block**: Pointer to select div/node
- **Live capture**: Screenshot, photo, audio clip

**Two Uses:**
1. **Style guide**: Convey intent without user detailing in full
2. **Primary source**: Focus AI on attachment contents

**Design Considerations:**
- Allow attachments at any time
- Use multiple input methods
- Let users give attachments a purpose
- Provide citations when referencing files
- Protect organizational data

---

### 3.2 Modes
**Adjust underlying training, constraints, and persona to specific context.**

**Types of Modes:**

- Proactive platform rules (halt on sensitive data)
- User overrides (settings/instructions)

**Design Considerations:**
- Match friction to risk
- Use opt-out settings for control
- Make clear if verification is skipped
- Alert user when action is needed

---

### 4.4 Controls
**Manage flow of information or pause request mid-stream.**

**Common Controls:**
- **Stop button**: End request mid-generation
- **Pause button**: Stop without losing progress
- **Fast-forward**: Skip ahead in longer responses
- **Play**: Start new task
- **Queue**: Stack tasks for AI to complete

**Design Considerations:**
- Stop runs in a click
- Provide graceful pause and resume
- Let users act in flow of work
- Use variations instead of overwriting

---

### 4.5 Shared Vision
