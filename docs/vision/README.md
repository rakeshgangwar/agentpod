# Vision & Future Concepts

> **Status:** Visionary / Not Implemented  
> **Purpose:** Future roadmap, research, and experimental concepts

This folder contains documentation for **future concepts and vision** that are not yet part of the current AgentPod product. These documents represent explorations, research, and long-term strategic thinking.

## How to Use This Section

1. **For inspiration** - Explore possible futures for AgentPod
2. **For planning** - Use as input for roadmap discussions
3. **For research** - Reference patterns and concepts

## Important Notes

These documents represent **future possibilities**, not current product features:

- Do not reference these docs as current functionality
- Features may never be implemented exactly as described
- Ideas evolve as the product develops

---

## Moving to Implementation

When a vision concept is ready for implementation:

1. Create a new doc in `/implementation/` with concrete plan
2. Reference the vision doc as background
3. Update this README to note the transition
