# AgentPod

AgentPod is a **fleet/facilities console for agent runtimes** — a single place to manage the environments that AI agents live in, wherever they run. For each runtime it manages the **filesystem, logs, terminal, config, health, lifecycle, cleanup, and provisioning**, across machines, harnesses, and network boundaries. It is **attach-first**: you point it at runtimes you already run, or let it provision new ones.

## Architecture — three tiers

| Tier | Technology | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| **node-agent** | Go (static binary) | Installed per host; dials *out* to the hub over WSS. Runs harness descriptors, executes contract verbs locally. No inbound ports — works behind NAT/CGNAT. |
| **hub** | Bun + Hono, Drizzle + Postgres | Registry, connection broker, enrollment, auth (Better Auth), audit, provisioning drivers. Self-hostable. |
| **console** | SvelteKit (adapter-static SPA) | Fleet-first UI: node list → station tree → capability panels (filesystem, logs, terminal, config, health, lifecycle, cleanup). |

## Harnesses detected (v0.1.0)

AgentPod ships descriptors for: **Hermes**, **OpenClaw**, **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**.

Each descriptor wraps the harness's native CLI/API to enumerate runtimes, locate config/logs/workspace, and implement lifecycle — without reinventing each harness's introspection.

## Quickstart

> Full instructions: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) (production) · [docs/OPERATING.md](./docs/OPERATING.md) (day-2 ops)

**1. Run the hub**

```bash
# Prereqs: Postgres + bun
cd apps/hub
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY, API_TOKEN
bun run src/index.ts   # auto-migrates on first start
```

**2. Build + deploy the console**

```bash
cd apps/console
PUBLIC_HUB_URL=https://<your-hub> pnpm build   # emits apps/console/build/
# Deploy build/ to Cloudflare Pages at console.<your-domain>
# (wrangler pages deploy ../console/build, or Git-integrated Pages project)
```

> The console must be served from a subdomain of the hub's registrable domain (e.g. `console.<your-domain>` when the hub is `hub.<your-domain>`). This keeps them **same-site** so the Better Auth session cookie is sent. Opening a raw `*.pages.dev` URL breaks auth — always use the custom domain. For local development any static server works (`npx serve build`).


**3. Enroll a node-agent**

```bash
# On the target host — downloads the prebuilt binary and installs a systemd service:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rakeshgangwar/agentpod/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- https://<your-hub> <token-from-console>
systemctl status agentpod-node   # node appears online in the console
```

> Binaries are published for linux/darwin × amd64/arm64 on every `v*` tag by `.github/workflows/release-node-agent.yml`.
>
> **From source (repo checkout):** `cd apps/node-agent && go build -o agentpod-node ./cmd/agentpod-node`, then `sudo bash scripts/install-node-agent.sh https://<your-hub> <token>`.

See [docs/OPERATING.md](./docs/OPERATING.md) for enrolling nodes, adopting stations, driving terminals/files/logs, and provisioning runtimes.

## Status

**v0.1.0** — single-operator (one admin account; signup closes after the first user). Multi-tenancy (orgs, tenant isolation, billing) is a deliberate post-release effort targeting v0.2.0.

## Legacy / OpenCode era

The previous OpenCode-based product is frozen at tag **`v0.0.4-opencode`**. Archived docs are under [`docs/archive/`](./docs/archive/).
